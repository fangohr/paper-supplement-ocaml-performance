This repository contains some test programs that help investigating the
performance of code emitted by the OCaml compiler (`ocamlopt`) for some of
simple cases which are particularly relevant to numerical code. The tests are
provided in separate directories. Each directory contains the OCaml version and
the C++ version of the same test. Here is a list of the available directories:

1. [`multidim-arrays`](multidim-arrays): test accesses to multi dimensional
   arrays implemented (i) as regular OCaml arrays and (ii) using the `Bigarray`
   OCaml module.

2. [`array-sum`](array-sum): test addition of two large unidimensional arrays.

3. [`summation`](summation): test computation with low memory bandwidth
   requirements

See the README files in the individual subdirectories for more details on
the investigations performed and results obtained.
