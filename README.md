# Small OCaml performance study

Supplement for manuscript "Nmag micromagnetic simulation tool -- software engineering lessons learned" by Hans Fangohr and Matteo Franchin (2016).

This repository contains programs that help investigating the performance of
code emitted by the OCaml compiler (ocamlopt) for some of simple cases
which are particularly relevant to numerical code.

See the README files in the individual subdirectories for details on
the investigations performed and results obtained.
