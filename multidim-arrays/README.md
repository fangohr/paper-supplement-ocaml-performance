# Multi-dimensional arrays

Example testing performance of multi-dimensional arrays in OCaml and C.  We
create an array of rank-3 tensors of size 3x3x3, populate them with some
numbers and then compute the square root of the average of the squares of all
the tensors entries.

This directory contains 3 programs that do this, but using different
language/representation of multi-dimensional arrays:

1. `array_test.ml`: OCaml code, where the tensor array is an array of arrays of
    arrays...

2. `bigarray_test.ml`: OCaml code where we use a `Bigarray.Genarray`.

3. `carray_test.cc`: C++ code where we use a regular C array.

The output of running make (on an Intel Core i5-6600 processor running at
3.3 GHz) is the following:

It can be seen that regular arrays (1) are very slow in the creation phase
(~1 s) while both bigarrays (2) and C arrays (3) are very fast. On the other hand
regular arrays (1) are faster to initialise and much faster to access than
bigarrays (2). The overall outcome is that the C example runs in about 0.4 s
while the OCaml examples run in about 1.8 s (A) and 1.3 s (B). Crucially,
access time for bigarrays is more than an order of magnitude greater than for
C, while using regular OCaml arrays introduces setup time delays that are
simply not present in the other programs (2 and 3).
